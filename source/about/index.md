# The Blog
- The blog hosts all the things that the maintainer(she/her) is interested in, mainly programming, reading, language learning.
- Note: In order to maintain a clean and professional blog, the maintainer moved most of the old posts into  [stash](https://github.com/zhongqin0820/zhongqin0820.github.io/tree/source-articles/source/_drafts) in 2020/08/23 and **guaranteed no more ðŸ’© posts since then**.

# The Maintainer
- She is an enthusiastic sharer who likes to share those useful and helpful contents to others.

## Her Motto
> Talent you have naturally.
> Skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on your craft.
> Just decide what is gonna be, who you're gonna be and how you're gonna do it.
> **Will Smith** --- <cite>[Will Smith's Most Inspiring Quotes On Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2aDEYspVbQ&t=98s)</cite>

## Contacts
- Feel free to send her an [Email](mailto:zhongq26@mail3.sysu.edu.cn?subject=CVBlogs|What can I help you?) if you have any doubts about the posts.
- You can also find her on [GitHub](http://github.com/zhongqin0820), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/zoking), [Duolingo](https://duome.eu/anoni15).
