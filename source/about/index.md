# Motto
> Talent you have naturally.
> Skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on your craft.
> Just decide what is gonna be, who you're gonna be and how you're gonna do it.
> **Will Smith** --- <cite>[Will Smith's Most Inspiring Quotes On Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2aDEYspVbQ&t=98s)</cite>
