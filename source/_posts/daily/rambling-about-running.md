# Introduction
The title of this post is quite a pitfall in order to expand its influence. But having run 1,000k with NRC (i.e., Nike+ Running Club app) is truly a milestone to me. And also it means I should take consideration of joining a marathon, which I have always planned to do this year, even at the moment I write down the word 'marathon' I feel like I will do it.
This post is mainly about me rambling about what I thought or felt after I finished having run 1,000k in the latest five years (i.e., 2014~2019). And selected out my favourite workout in each year for commemoration.

# Motivation
I can't quite remember the purpose of why I start to run and the exact time when I start to run continuously. But the intention of keeping fit should obviously be my number one reason in the list. And try to enhance my perseverance and build up my self-discipline of doing something is another by-product of running.

Will Smith once said in one of his interviews, that if you want to build a wall, then the only thing you need to do is to lay the brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid; and you do this every single day, soon you'll have a wall. For me, to keep running is like building this kind of wall, and each workout likes a brick need to be laid.

# During the time
At the very beginning, the importance of the distance quite takes a portion of my running. After having run 1,000k, I think the distance does not count anything, what count the most is your running pace and your persistence of continue running in each run. Running at 11min/km with longer distance (e.g., 10k) and 6min/km with shorter distance (e.g., 5k) are totally two different things. The former seems a waste of your time, the only thing you benefit from it, is to divert your mind from some trouble you're suffering for a while. I don't mean there are no benefits from it but if you want to maximize your productivity, you'd better choose the latter one. That is what I am trying to do now.

## 2019, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou
The day I finished having run 1,000k.

## 2018, Central Park, Shenyang
Having suffered a lot in 2018, I decided to come back to run in that summer. This is one of the workouts at the time.

## 2015, Northeastern University, Shenyang
Seeing the running route makes me quite feel contented, though I totally forget what I thought during this running.

## 2014, Hometown, Fuan
The summer of 2014 when I finished my Gaokao, is the earliest time I remembered when I decide to make up my mind running.
However, it is a regret that NRC closed its services of history data dashboard in the web page and in the app it only keeps the latest 5 years of running history data without sending a notification to its users (maybe it once sent the notification, but I neglected it).

# Next...
Run at different but the same beautiful places where I could find.
Run a marathon in 2019.
Run to the end.
