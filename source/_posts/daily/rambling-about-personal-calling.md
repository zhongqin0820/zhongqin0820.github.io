# Main
At the age of 25, I have received a personal calling along with the happiness of being a human who can now take her responsibilities from nature. Not too soon and not too late. It is just at a perfect time that I still have enough fire in my belly to stick to it.

I remember that when in the senior school days, the history teacher once said that everyone lives in the world was born to find his or her [Zero Point Field Energy](https://www.zeropointfieldenergy.com/). I didn't get her quote at the time but now I think I have found mine. With this energy, you can do the thing without caring about your physical strengths. Your mind power will fill the gap.

It is so-called a personal legend that defined in 'The Alchemist', which written by Paulo Coelho published in late 19s. In his book, he says that "When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it". Sincerely be a human, I long for the meaning of one's life. What can she do and what the rank she can reach within her limited life? This year, I have read a lot and listened a lot about these topics. But not until recently, that is during my two weeks summer break. I made up my mind to do something, this thought is not very complicated but it comes naturally. That is the participation of a great project related to LGBT+ community. A wind blows and I receive it from her. Its intention should only be pure and only in that way that I can insist to or I will be disgusting about. 

However, I did get lost in the mind during the journey sometimes. But now with Paulo's words, I think I have the strength to stick to it. Just wait and see, history has its own eyes. And that happiness is what I want to share in this post. The happiness of being a messenger of nature and understand why I live.
