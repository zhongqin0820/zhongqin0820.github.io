# Main
When I was little, there was a strange thought in my mind that scar is a cool thing to make kids look cooler. Thus, I was desperate to have a scar on my body, like, on my arm or on my leg but definitely not on my face. After that, I could brag it or differentiate from others. It is a weird thought I should admit now and it is lucky for me that this thought never come into reality. Especially after reading "Wonder", I am suspent that whether I have the courage to live with the scars.

In the book, it is cruelty that little Auggie has a terrible facial abnormality, which has resulted in him having 27 surgeries. He doesn't choose the scars but the scars choose him. Thus, he was too cool to be accepted by the people who only meet him at the first time or don't know him deeply. It is common for me that there are several abnormity kids in my school but never have a kid like Auggie ever appear in my life. And when I was reading the book, I always assumed that if I was there, whether I would perform well or behave well when I met Auggie. And I think the answer is absolutely CANN'T. Franly speaking, as I mentioned before, I never met a kid like that, so even I am a good person, it is hard for me to not be shocked at the first sight. But I promise the soon after, I will get used to it.

The book have been trumpeted as "a book that made grown men weep" and I admit it that I cann't help it several times during reading it and watching the corresponding movie, especially the movie, the actors are so good at performing the story. And the reason is it always make you draw back to the old times at school that have you did well to others or make you to reveal some memories at the time. Back to the novel, the words the author used are plain but very touching. You will have a good experience during reading it, sometimes sadness sometimes happiness floats you up and down.

# Conclusion
The book also teaches me one important thing is that do not care too much about others' words, just live your own colorful life. And also, BE KIND TO OTHERS.
Unfortunately I am still suck at writing, I know the words are in my mind but I just cann't figure out. Here I attach a really good review of this book in the [Links](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/children_sbookreviews/9099174/Wonder-by-R.J-Palacio-review.html) section. Hopefully, it will declare clearly my thoughts.
