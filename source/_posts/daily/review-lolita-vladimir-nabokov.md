# Main
On June 25th, I bought Lolita unconsciously and shelved it at the same time I knew what the novel involving. That is, not until recently I have made up my mind to read it. After reading it, which is 2 days ago, I find myself hard to appraise it. Though the words are much worth appreciating still I found myself gaining nothing from this book.

[//]: # (I read this book during my 2 weeks summer break.)

Regard it as a writing guide book? Yes but no. Yes for the techniques the author used but no for they are too hard for me to master and apply at the moment.

Regard it as a time-killing book? Well, that makes senses as it contains some taboo topic that seldom mentioned in public classics and it easily arouses the reader's attention and full fill some peculiar interests.

Regret for the characters' destinies? Not at all, for me, Lo is an innate doltish evil who met two depriving monsters, one awoken its human morality in the end and killed another one. But once mourn for the death of Lo's mother.

# Others
By the way, Jeremy did a great job by interpreting it in the audio form, which relieves the disgusting backgrounds of the story and boosts the feelings transmitted from "Humbert".
