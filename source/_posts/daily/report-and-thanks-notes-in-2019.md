# Introduction
Inspired by E.B. White's essay 'A Report in Spring', I decided to make my report in 2019 and give my thanks notes to those who have helped me before/during the time.

# Report
## Good side
In many aspects, I gain most of the achievements through pains, mentally and physically.
In finance management, I restart investing in ETF with not much money. So far, I'm proud to announce that the earnings rate surpasses 81.31 % of people in my neighbourhood. My strategy is naive and it works in a way that you set a sell-out bound and always hold the stake until it reaches the target bound. I have to admit that I was lucky enough to see it brings me earnings finally.

Moreover, I have found there is an obvious key factor floats the market this year that is the relationship between our country and the United States. It's funny that every time the stock line drops, investors cursed that it's Trump that tweets stupid words again. All the deals are done in AliPay and as a heavy user of their products, I use it to record my step counts and get-up time records as well as play Ant Forest by collecting green energies :) which I have to admit that all the things are stupid but they quite relieve my anxieties.

Another habit I built that relieves my anxiety is learning Spanish in [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/). Also, I have rebuilt my English basics by owning a gold owl award in it. Not only I start reading books in English and writing in English but also I practise oral English with my friend which make me believe I can be better and better in using English.

</div>

About books, I still use [Douban](http://douban.com/) as my main online reading logs manager but I also start using Goodreads to store those in English and here is my [Year in Books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2019/89404830).

Due to my major background, I committed 772 submissions in [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and 499 contributions in [Github](https://github.com/) so far this year. Although most of them are useless snippets, I think it represents my dedication to train myself to be a good programmer and I believe I can be better by insisting to do so.

In time management, I still use diaries to record my daily life but I start using [Time Blocks](https://www.douban.com/app/26850600/) to quantify my time usages and it works quite well. It shows that 26% of my time was used in coding/doing related works which compares to 31% of my time used in sleep but shame on me that no more than 4% of my time was spent in research which is even 2% lower than the time I spent in learning languages.

## Bad side
As an old saying goes, a coin has two sides and it's time to flip to the other side.
Firstly, I have done badly in health management. Shame on myself that I declared I will run a marathon this year. It's very embarrassing that you cannot reach the goal that declared earlier in public. At the time I watched a movie named 'Brittany runs a marathon', I was confused why it's so meaningful for her to run a marathon and how difficult it will be for a person who wants to do it. The next moment, I reflected that I was exactly another Brittany. It makes me upset that I imagined the possibilities to prepare for a marathon and it turns out very difficult when I graduate and need to work. But it's very accidental that I participate in a mountaineering activity one week ago hosted by [WildHikers](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/oSV50FsaOhFLht7HGF81RA) which is a team composed of women.

Secondly, I have no new publications and no new works done in this year. This is another shame on me. Though I have tried hard the outcomes are not good. Its cause is the negative feedback in the cycle and I resist to do study works in my mind. Hope things will change in the new year or the next days.

Thirdly, my communication skills are still not good enough which exposed thoroughly in my failed interviews. And also it always makes me awkward to have a speech in front of people or talk with some strangers but I'm willing to overcome this difficulty by joining more meet-ups(not started yet) and having a peer to peer talk.
