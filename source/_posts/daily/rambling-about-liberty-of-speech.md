# Introduction
It is a sunny day today after suffering 2 to 3 wet rainy days. At 4 p.m., I go downstairs intend to buy myself a can of coca-cola on the vending machine to refresh myself. The sun as shiny as it always shines before. Unluckily, there is a family of school visitors on the line in front of me, thus, I have to wait and wonder my mind casually.

# Main
Suddenly, a rhythm echoes in my mind, it is One Day More in the musical Les Misérables. A very catchy song, the family still don't finish their deal. Since it will take a long time to wait for them, I decided to take out my phone to hum the song in a low voice to entertain myself a while. 

As I sing to the line "Do you hear the people sing?", I recall another story related to it. It was two months ago when my lab members and I were returning to the dormitory at around half-past ten. On the road, we usually teased at our mentor, who is a pushy man around his forties, as an entertainment and a relief of pressure that he has given. But that night, I remembered one of my mate casually mentioned about one of the biggest news the Hk 616 parade and something related. 

Naive as I always am, I took his words out of context and commented vulgarly at it with prejudice that HK people are a group with persecution paranoia. In that case, all our mainland government need to is to keep in silent and wait until their voice quiets down. At that night, I thought the whole thing is closed since then. Nothing is a big deal, life will move on and the earth will continue spinning.

But, I don't realize the song as a theme song sang in the parade will be banned in the mainland after a few days later. It shocked me. In the beginning, I considered it is the stream provider issues, but after I have googled it I eventually have to admit that it is the government decision to ban the song.

What's wrong will it be with a song? Among all the interview videos I watched, they mentioned about human rights, the liberty of speech frequently. I don't quite take the notion of it since I was occupied by other boring things, with the spare time I have now, I decided to figure it out. But unfortunately, I was interrupted again that the family has completed their transactions eventually and left; there are another two more people wait after me during my wondering. Thus, I buy my drink and leave quickly to back to my office. Still confused, up to the stairs, I decide not to open the coke as a self-imposed dedicate to the liberty of drinking. I drink as I want.

# Conclusion
> No more words. No more words. It's a time that is dead.
> There are words. That are better unheard, better unsaid.
