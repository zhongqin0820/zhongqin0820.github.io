# Introduction
After I finished watching the hit HBO series [Gentleman Jack](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7211618/), I couldn't help myself to want to know more about Anne Lister deeply and thoroughly. During the time, I was reading the famous Wuthering Heights written by Emily Brontë, the writer who lived near Anne at the time. Apparently, it perplexed me that why Anne Lister was so different from the female characters under Emily Brontë's and what if Emily had met Anne, will it influence her writing of Wuthering Heights? Other things that I'm interested in are the kind of geek style codebook and how does the decoding process work? And also the pleasure of peeping one's diaries that the writer has no idea about it. Of the most importance, I want to know the history during that period since I'm a big fan of horrible histories.

# Preliminary
## What interests you?
Before you start reading, you need to ask yourself, what are your interests? Is the detail of her daily routines that interests you? the diary writing technique or contents? the 'kisses' with her many lovers? the geek style codebook? the life after marrying Ann? You may have your own answers. Most of mine were answered by Steidele Angela in her book.

## Pick one
After a while of searching and sorting the materials. On the [Resources](#Resources) section, I selected some useful items out of the massive materials, that I discovered on the internet, including a documentary which I think is necessary to know more about her and four recent publications about her and Anne's life in her diaries; and some other miscellaneous that related to her.

### Steidele Angela “Gentleman Jack”
And among four of them, I highly recommend the second one, which written by Angela Steidele, named [Gentleman Jack: A biography of Anne Lister, Regency Landowner, Seducer and Secret Diarist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40054063-gentleman-jack), published in 2018.

Although some of the readers in [douban.com](https://book.douban.com/subject/34431273/) may think Angela Steidele, the author, is not pertinent enough to write about Anne and underestimate the book. But trust me, this book definitely worth 3.5/5 which I will explain later in the [main](#Main) section.

From this book, you can find out how she progressively becomes the Anne Lister we knew. As the journalist [Sue Perkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Perkins) said at the end of the documentary:
> But if you're looking for a luminous Regency heroine, you should tread carefully, because, for me, Anne is a much more complicated creature than that.
> **[Sue Perkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Perkins)** --- <cite>[Revealing Anne Lister](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av24483831)</cite>

And the author of the book also commented at the end of her book:
> First she seduced me, then she betrayed me. What I liked even more than Anne Lister’s astoundingly open way of speaking about her desire was her certainty of herself: her desire was an expression of her nature, and that was that.
> **Steidele Angela** --- <cite>[Gentleman Jack: A biography of Anne Lister, Regency Landowner, Seducer and Secret Diarist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40054063-gentleman-jack)</cite>

### Helena Whitbread “The Secret Diaries Of Miss Anne Lister”
I think this book is a decode version of Anne Lister's diaries and it turns out a good example of writing a diary with a comparison of E.B. White's [One Man's Meat](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10813.One_Man_s_Meat).

But what I am interested the most is not her routine details since I am not a good summary maker and I want someone to make a full analysis of her life from her birth to her death for me. That is why I didn't pick up this book due to its chronological range; though it definitely worths reading. This feeling became stronger after I finished reading the one from Steidele Angela.

Using the keyword search, you can easily refer to some of the details interest you the most in “The Secret Diaries Of Miss Anne Lister”. Here are the excerpts about Anne met Ann before 1832 in it.

- 1821
    - “Tuesday 12 June [Halifax]
    - At 10¾, Miss Rawson (Catherine) & Miss Crackenthorpe… called & staid ½ hour, Miss Rawson to say that, as it was Whitsuntide week, her father & mother did not like her to be out & hoped we should excuse her coming this evening… In the afternoon, at 5¼, walked along the new road & got past Pump when Miss Ann Walker of Crownest overtook me, having run herself almost out of breath. Walked with her as far as the Lidget entrance to their own grounds & got home at 6.40. Made myself, as I fancied, very agreeable & was particularly civil & attentive in my manner. I really think the girl is flattered by it & likes me. She wished me to drink tea with them. I hoped for another walk to Giles House & the readiness she expressed shewed that my proposition was by no means unwelcome. She has certainly no aversion to my conversation & company. After parting I could not help smiling to myself & saying the flirting with this girl has done me good. It is heavy work to live without women’s society & I would far rather while away an hour with this girl, who has nothing in the world to boast but good[…]”
- index
    - “Cliff Hill and Crow Nest – two of the properties forming part of the Walker estate in Lightcliffe, adjacent to the Shibden estate. In 1830, Ann Walker became co-heiress, along with her sister Elizabeth, to the estate. In 1834, Ann moved into Shibden Hall to live with Anne Lister as her wife. See ‘The Walkers of Crow Nest’, in Female Fortune: Land, Gender and Authority by Jill Liddington, River Orams Press, 1988 (pp.27–38).”
    - “Ann Walker – at this point, Anne Lister had no deep interest in her young neighbour. A decade later, however, there was a dramatic shift in Anne Lister’s attitude towards her. [See n.1.]”
- 1822
    - “Tuesday 18 June [Halifax]
    - Dined at 5¼, and at 6¼ off in the gig to Crownest, to take a walk with Miss Ann Walker, having talked of it ever since my walk with her last year. Only her sister & herself at home. They could not both leave the house & Miss Ann Walker & I was tête-à-tête… Very civil, etc, but she is a stupid vulgar girl. Indeed, I scarce know which of the party is the least vulgar & I have no intention of taking more walks or letting the acquaintance go one jot further. I asked her to come to Shibden & walk in our valley & here I hope the thing will end.”

## Supplementary
This section is based on Steidele Angela book. But some of them may also helpful since it relates to Anne.

First thing first, reading “Prologue: Deciphering Anne Lister’s Diaries” & “Epilogue: Reading Anne Lister’s writing” will give you a clear clue about the motivation of this book and how the book was arranged. And from "Timeline" combining with the content, you can easily sort out the timeline of Anne's whole life. That will give you more concrete abstract of what will happen in this book or once happened in Anne's life.

During the reading, I also maintain a sharing google map which records most of her travel routes and I named it as "[Fantastic Anne Lister: Where She Had Been](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?hl=en&mid=1zTkajatR7OgMHKJovySa4usPcxNJPgGg&ll=53.05619030552258%2C-2.5491907273475363&z=6)" with a reference of the movie "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them". Taking a look at it may give you some clues about where she had been in her whole life. And also with the selected items in the left panel, you can easily tell how many places she had been before she met Ann and how many places she had been with Ann.

# Main
## Emily Brontë
Steidele Angela made a bold assumption in her book that Emily clearly wrote Anne and Ann into her book. This gives me a fresh reflection of Emily's work.

By the way, I also maintained a google map about them "[Anne Lister & Her Time](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?hl=en&mid=1kBAsUzFg86dp8cpL-apd0iXbyn8OGHNZ&ll=53.73532976043602%2C-1.7774499080886699&z=10)". The Brontë is at a distance of nearly 14 kilometres. Click the image and you can find more details.

## Histories
Reading the content written by a real existed person at the time, when you're familiar with and interested at, is a really enjoyable experience. It will give you another viewpoint about the historical events, e.g., the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1819 and the July Revolution in 1830.

## Anne Lister
Back to Anne, when I read the book, sometimes she makes me piss off and if I could I would tear her into pieces and shout at her in her face "You monster, jerk, villain...! You bloody hell Tory...! Look what you have done...". But there are also many times I find out she is as lovable as ever I thought and want to wish her all well.

The emotions about her are quite complex and always not settled, I think this is because I overestimated her at the very beginning that I considered her as a perfect person but soon find out the gap is a little bit of large. But just as the lines that Fantine sang in the 'Les Miserables' musical, "Is there anyone here. Who can swear before God. She has nothing to fear? She has nothing to hide?". She didn't choose to expose herself before us, it is us that choose her.

As Dickens said at the beginning of his "A Tale of Two Cities", I want to make a comment of her that she is a person of attentive, she is a person of selfish, she is a person of candid, she is a person of villainous, she may not perfect enough, she isn't that bad - in short, she is just a person like you and me with flaws and merits but lives her life like an epic, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

Alas, of the most important, what can you learn from her life experiences?

### Her diary
Since a sixth of the content of her diaries is encrypted, the first thing interests me is her codebook due to my speciality, how does the encode/decode process work? How hard could it be by using OCR techniques to decode? If you are also interested, you may refer to this [thesis](#Thesis). But it turns out really hard for me to figure out since the calligraphy is in italic and the informal cryptography process and codebook.

What does she read? Some books she read that mentioned in the biography are the classics in Greeks/France before her time but no fictions like 'The Red and the Black' by Stendhal that published at her time that most of them were considered as classics nowadays.

And another thing that interests me is how does she maintain her body? Is that yoga or something else? To find the answer, you can refer to the google map I maintain "[Anne Lister & Her Time](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?hl=en&mid=1kBAsUzFg86dp8cpL-apd0iXbyn8OGHNZ&ll=53.73532976043602%2C-1.7774499080886699&z=10)" that she do brisk walking almost every day when she was in Halifax.

> Anne, however, needed her daily marches; she covered the six-mile walk from Ripponden to Halifax in two hours.
> **Steidele Angela** --- <cite>[Gentleman Jack: A biography of Anne Lister, Regency Landowner, Seducer and Secret Diarist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40054063-gentleman-jack)</cite>

Also, what did she do during the day?
> This redoubled attention towards Isabella showed itself in Anne getting up at 5:30 to see to the horses in the stable. From seven to nine, she studied Greek and French, from nine to ten overseeing work on the estate. Isabella joined her at ten for breakfast. Between eleven and two, Anne kept an eye on the workers again and then went for a walk with Isabella. They sat down to dinner with Anne’s aunt and uncle at half-past four. After that, Anne took care of her correspondence before they all met up again for coffee at eight. At ten o’clock, Anne was the first to retire, writing her journal before going to bed.
> **Steidele Angela** --- <cite>[Gentleman Jack: A biography of Anne Lister, Regency Landowner, Seducer and Secret Diarist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40054063-gentleman-jack)</cite>

And some useful tips from the diaries about time management is “Thanks to her marked need to measure the time, many of her days can be reconstructed down to fifteen-minute intervals.”

At last, what does her diary covered? Obviously, there are many 'kisses' and many travelogs since she has so many lovers and have been to so many places. However, according to the biography that “It was always about three taboo subjects: sex, money and clothes.” and “Her daily notes on the weather, including exact temperatures, could be used to draw up climate graphs for Yorkshire.”.

### Her travels
Seeing the well-known places even nowadays that she had been at her time in the map, the admiration of her courageous naturally from my heart.

<div style="width: 300px; margin: auto">

[![Places made by google map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhongqin0820/zhongqin0820.github.io/source-articles/source/images/review/tour-map.png)](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1kBAsUzFg86dp8cpL-apd0iXbyn8OGHNZ)
</div>

I quite understand her unwillingness of coming back home when they were in Russia. As a role of the husband in their relationship, she is afraid of losing Ann like losing her many lovers again and facing all the pressure and responsibilities from mental and physical. In 1839, she is already 48 years old and her aunt who she can talk to has already died in 1836.
> Neither politics nor business life, neither her studies nor love had brought her success, happiness or satisfaction. To evade the realisation that she had failed at everything she set her hand to, she took flight one last time: "My love of travel is as great as ever."
> **Steidele Angela** --- <cite>[Gentleman Jack: A biography of Anne Lister, Regency Landowner, Seducer and Secret Diarist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40054063-gentleman-jack)</cite>

I think although it is Isabella who influences Anne to travel abroad and to explore the world, however, it is her great aunt Anne senior and her great wife Ann Walker that companied her to those places, especially Ann. The top 3 among her many travels are:
- 1840, “From Moscow to the Caucasus”, with Ann Walker
    - This is the toughest and the most exciting trip in her life though ended as a tragic
- 1830, "Crossed the border between France and Spain at Bosost", alone
    - Quite interesting to see her intend to cross the border
- 1822, “Llangollen, the home of Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Sarah Ponsonby”, with Anne senior
    - A tour of self-awareness

## Ann Walker
The tears just come out of my eyes when I read about what Ann Walker suffered and her death at the end of the book. And most of my furious about Anne is from what she has done to her wife, who deserves to be remembered as the same as Anne. If you are convenient, you can help to fund [Ann Walker Memorial](https://www.gofundme.com/f/ann-walker-memorial?member=2470096) to establish a new memorial in her honour.

> Ann Walker proved just as brave as Anne Lister by moving in with her and sitting in the front pew with her at church. Despite anonymous marriage announcements ridiculing Captain Tom Lister and Ann Walker, the two women laid the foundation stone for the Northgate Hotel together, clearly a couple – an emancipatory milestone in the history of women loving women.
> **Steidele Angela** --- <cite>[Gentleman Jack: A biography of Anne Lister, Regency Landowner, Seducer and Secret Diarist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40054063-gentleman-jack)</cite>

Although “Ann Walker’s parental home no longer exists; its grounds have been converted to a golf course.” and “Only the old estate wall remains from the days when Anne Lister was such a frequent visitor.”, from the map below, you can easily tell in geography that they are just at a short distance of 3km.

Like I said earlier in this post, it is Ann Walker who companied her been to many places.

# The End
In my limited reading experiences, this is the first time I read about nonfiction that related to the LGBT+ group. I have gained much more than I have said in this post.

From my reading logs, it costs me nearly one month to finish reading the book and 3 days to cover this post. All in all, I hope it will be helpful to those who come across this post.
