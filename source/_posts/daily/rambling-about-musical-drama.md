# Introduction
In this post, I try to figure out what is the definition of the musical. On top of that, I share some shallow thoughts of musical and recommend some of my favourite discographies from the musical I have listened to so far.

# Main
## Preliminary
The musical is a genre of artistic expression, including drama, film, series related to music mixed with dialogues. Musical or musical drama? In order to classify it from the plain dialogues of drama, we take musical drama as musical and mention other forms of presentation with a prefix musical to distinguish itself from others. Musical or opera? Although both of their contents are very rich, the opera is more like a concert than a musical.

Musical or drama? Though both performed on stage in live, however, it is more strict to an actor to become a musical performer than a drama performer since the former has a strict requirement of singing and dancing. And it is also harder for us than the people in 1800s to access musical and drama in live since we seldom go to the theatre nowadays. For the audience, without previous getting used to this kind of performance, some may feel awkward or embarrassed to watch it not even admire it.

Back to drama, it is kind of a "renaissance" today if you are inclined to watch drama at a theatre since the media evolution leads us to more modern choice, especially the stream genres. From the 1900s, when the silent film has first been invented to entertain people and present the world in a black box in front of people, the casting techniques and end devices were improved very quickly to assist us to entertain ourselves at anywhere and at any time. The convenience and the vivid presentation and rich contents make people nowadays more likely to watch videos on their phones, and also, watch movies at the cinema rather than watch dramas at the theatre.

Then for the musical, simply, the musical is a drama mixed evenly with dialogues and singing and dancing during the performing. London's West End and New York's Broadway are considered as the two main centres of musical in the world due to the historical influences. In the film industry, there is a genre of musical film that also introduces music in the dialogues. Though classic musical films in the USA, like singin' in the Rain in the early 1950s and recently the Frozen and the La La Land etc.; and classic musical series like the Glee are famous among the generations; however, musical need to be watched calmly; thus, it becomes a niche activity due to the conflict of an unstoppable speedy development of modern society and people's impetuous hearts.

But less attention doesn't mean it is different from other forms of entertainment. As far as I'm concerned, watching or listening to a musical is the same as watching a soap opera. They have no differences; moreover as a note to myself, should not have those kinds of superiority or prejudice or bring them into the mind and not even ask for what it can bring. All we need to do is enjoy it in relax.

## Personal Recommendation
If you are in search of some classic musical, here are some from my personal collection.

### English(UK)
#### [Les Misérables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables_(musical))
- Favourite Discography: [All of them](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av746517) worthed your time to listen to.
- Reason: Will have a different understanding of the original novel each time.

### French
There are tons of the classics have been adapted into fabulous musical in French, mainly the [Dove Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dove_Attia) team.
#### [1789, Les Amants de la Bastille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1789:_Les_Amants_de_la_Bastille)
Though there are more songs worth recommending. I select one from them as a hit.
- Favorite Discography: "[Au Palais royal / Les prostituées](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av18398562/)" (David Ban) - 3:27
- Reason: Two days after watching the official released video, this song just echos in my head itself. Quite catchy.

#### [Legally Blonde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legally_Blonde_(musical))
- Favourite Discography: "[There! Right There!](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av30600383)" – Elle, Callahan, Emmett, Brooke, Vivienne, Warner, Enid, Judge, Nikos, Carlos and Company
- Reason: This song worths listening due to its sense of humour.

# Conclusion
I first came across to musical at the time when I casually listen to the Les Misérables soundtracks album at iTunes. I am fascinated at it and it caught me when the song “Do you hear the people sing?” has been played. How shook the melody is and how heartening of the lyrics conveyed to me. I felt I got understand and got a power of running away from the secular world and it brings me back to the ever-changing 1800s. Freedom is nothing but all I can ask and want.

But not until recently, I have started to make my mind to establish a whole knowledge structural about musical. As I dig more about it, I love more about it; this is why this post of a recommendation and sharing be published. If you also love music, you gotta have a try. Some of them may change yours as well as my stereotype of musical.
