# Introduction
> "May she wake in torment!" he cried, with frightful vehemence, stamping his foot, and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion. "Why, she's a liar to the end! Where is she? Not there—not in heaven—not perished—where? Oh! you said you cared nothing for my sufferings! And I pray one prayer—I repeat it till my tongue stiffens—Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living; you said I killed you—haunt me, then! The murdered do haunt their murderers, I believe-I know that ghosts have wandered on earth. Be with me always—take any form—drive me mad! only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh, God! it is unutterable! I cannot live without my life! I cannot live without my soul!"
> **Emily Brontë** --- <cite>[Wuthering Heights](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6185.Wuthering_Heights)</cite> chapter 16, page 161-162

# Main
## Reason for like
### Writing Techniques
I think what makes this novel became so extraordinary for me is its way of constructing the storytelling. The point of view is set at the third person narration and the timeline is range from the past to the moment. Reading the novel is like revealing a rumour or gossip together with Lockwood via Ellen Dean's narrative. That's quite a novel way to arrange the plots and that intrigues me to continue reading.

### Successful characterization
The story is quite ordinary due to its unavoidable love story mechanism that you can easily infer the plots just with a glance of the genealogy of the novel. The two intruders, mainly Heathcliff destabilized the relationship between the two families. The conflicts in the novel are mainly between Heathcliff and the other characters. Each time the explosion of his stormy emotions, which covered under his aloof appearances, pushes the novel to its climax. His earnest of love and craziness of revenge are the most fascinating parts of the novel. In the afterword of the novel, Juliet Barker commented that 'Wuthering Heights is a story about passion, possession and revenge' which I cannot agree more.

### Quarrel about love
In chapter 9, Catherine and Ellen Dean have a quarrel about love. I think this plot is quite classic and highly recommend to read. Here is a quote from Catherine. She knew that she will regret marrying Linton afterwards but she did it because she also knew that unites with Heathcliff is her degradation at the time. I think this is the conflict in her mind that the author wants to show the readers and makes us reflect. Here is a classic excerpt from the book about the metaphor of her love for Linton and Heathcliff.
> My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary.
> **Emily Brontë** --- <cite>[Wuthering Heights](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6185.Wuthering_Heights)</cite> chap 9, page 80

## Reasons for dislike
Though many people will consider Joseph as another successful character. But it is a horrible nightmare to readers like me that every time when Joseph showed up talked with his indistinguishable dialect-speaking words. I can barely understand a single word.

Due to its social limitations at the time, another reason for dislike, from a modern perspective, could be that it underestimated women. Though there is a character Ellen Dean who is more rational at the opposite of Catherine and Cathy, after reading the novel it strongly tends to leave an idea in the readers' mind that women are very emotional while always have blindness in love and they need to depend on men to live. I think this is vulgar and stupid masculism in whatever scale causes. And that is why the convention concepts about women are not easy to break down nowadays, e.g., at the old times, the imperial examination system implies that women cannot have knowledge about literature; while nowadays there is another rigid stereotype of women cannot be good at science or engineering and our society encourages women major in liberal arts now.

## One doubt
One thing confused me the most when I read from chapter 15 to 16 is that Catherine was kind of suddenly pregnant and died. At chapter 15, it ends with Linton's return from the church while almost found the secret between Catherine and Heathcliff. And suddenly at chapter 16, she died of dystocia after she gave birth of little Cathy. This plot seems unreasonable and so suddenly turned.

After searching from the internet, the answer is a little bit clear that in chapter 13, there once mentioned about the heir thing by Ellen Dean.
> Ah, I thought myself, she might recover, so waited on as she was. and there was double cause to desire it, for on her existence depended that of another; we cherished the hope that in a little while, Mr. Linton's heart would be gladdened, and his lands secured from a stranger's gripe, by the birth of an heir.

# Conclusion
For the novel, I always had a blurred mind about I've read the novel before. But after I finally began to read, I found myself totally misremembered it with some other books, e.g., The Three Musketeers etc.. Though they have no common plots, it is wired that the thought of 'have read it' just stick in my mind and I cannot get rid of it. Not until recently, I took my mind to read it again by coincidence since the Taobao shop which I visit often, behold the stock of the book and the coupon I have in hand is reaching its expiry date.

In the 1st day of June, the book finally came to my hand. But with a shortage of words, it was quite hard for me to barely read the novel. There were dozens of new words I've never met before and I put it aside for a few days with a thought that it will be shelved since then. Well, thanks to the [audio book](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av17528206) which first recorded by [LibriVox](https://librivox.org/wuthering-heights-by-emily-bronte/) and secondly edited by the user [小宗英语](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av17528206), which sum up to nearly 12 hours long in [bilibili.com](https://www.bilibili.com/). I could finally sort of 'read' the novel and at least finish it in the end. And it is worth mentioning that another difficulty of reading the novel is, due to the lack of memorizing the names of the characters since the main characters from the novel have a mixed relationship in between. So I highly recommend you should first to make clear of the genealogy of the main characters. Here I attach the genealogy of the novel in the [Genealogy](#Genealogy) section and with some other helpful and related links in the [Links](#Links) section. Checkout and you may need them before you start to read the novel.

In the 20th day of June, I finished reading the novel. Felt quite contented and relieved after reading it. And during the time I read the novel, I happened to watch the HBO series called [Gentleman Jack](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7211618/) and it turned out that the series is adapted from nonfiction historical diaries which written by a woman, contemporary with the Brontë, named Anne Lister, who just lived around York, 14 kilometres near them. What a coincidence. That intrigues me to want to know more about the literature at the time, especially the works of literature about Anne.

This review takes me almost 3 to 4 days to finish it, though it still not good enough at least I tried. Hopefully, it will be useful to others who are reading this post.
