# Introduction
After I finished watching the HBO series [Gentleman Jack](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7211618/), which is a superbly written, masterfully performed and beautiful set and shot period drama, also a true history of a remarkable woman, Anne Lister, who was a unique and fasinating woman, compelling at and beyond her time, lived nearly 200 years ago in Halifax, UK.
I couldn't help meself to know more about her deeperly and throughly. During the time, I was reading the famous Wuthering Heights written by Emily Brontë, the writer who lived near Anne at the time. Apprently it perplexed me that why Anne Lister was so different with the female characters under Emily Brontë's and what if Emily have met Anne, what will happen? And also the kind of geek style codebook and how the decode process being done? And the feeling of peek one's diaries after her death and the write have no idea about it will be published. The most importantly, I want to know the history around that period.

# How to read the book
First thing first, reading “Prologue: Deciphering Anne Lister’s Diaries” & “Epilogue: Reading Anne Lister’s writing” will give you a clear mind about the motivation of this book and how the book was arranged. And from "Timeline" combining with the content, you can easily sort out the timeline of Anne's whole life. That will give you more concrete abstract of what will happen in this book or once happened in Anne's life.

# Main
After a while of searching and sorting the materials. On the [Resources](#Resources) section, I selected some useful items out of the massive materials, that I discovered on the internet, including a documentary which I think is necessary to know more about her and four recently publications about her and Anne's life in her diaries; and some other miscellaneous related to her. This [sharing](https://www.one-tab.com/page/yzx_8UpBTJi6iW1Ghbtv5A) link contains four main publications all in `.epub` file format which I list in the [Publications](#Publications) section, check it out that you may need it. And among four of them, I highly recommend the second one, which written by Angela Steidele, named [Gentleman Jack: A biography of Anne Lister, Regency Landowner, Seducer and Secret Diarist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40054063-gentleman-jack), published in 2018.
Through my reading experices, this is the first time I read about nonfiction historical diaries, and a genre of documentary I think. And it is also a good example of writting a diary with a comparision of E.B. White's [One Man's Meat](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10813.One_Man_s_Meat). From this book, you can find how Anne Lister became an Anne Lister. As the journalist [Sue Perkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Perkins) said at the end of documentary, 'but if you're looking for a luminous Regency heroins, you should tread carefully, because for me, Anne is a much more complicated creature than that.'

## Some thoughts
And I think which attracted me the most about her is:
> She is not a perfect but a true person existed in our history.

# Others
At the beginning, the book '[The Secret Diaries of Miss Anne Lister](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9505358-the-secret-diaries-of-miss-anne-lister)' which written by Helena Whitbread is the latest book I found at [annelister.co.uk](https://www.annelister.co.uk/). And I started to know more about Anne by reading the book; but after a few days I found the book [Gentleman Jack: A biography of Anne Lister, Regency Landowner, Seducer and Secret Diarist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40054063-gentleman-jack) written by Angela Steidele, which was also memtioned at the BBC documentary [Revealing Anne Lister](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av24483831), is much more suitable for reading.
That is, the former decoded the original diaries from 1816 to 1822 while the fascinating series 'Gentleman Jack' is adapted from 1832; and the latter almostly covered the range of her timeline. Thus, I changed my mind to focus on the latter one.

## Curious about Her Codebook?
As a computer science student, I originally thought with the help of OCR, could it be hard if we want to decrpt Anne's diaries? And though I have not much materials on hand, I found the codebook via [Rowanchild, Anira](http://oro.open.ac.uk/57998/)'s work in 1999. In this paper's appendix, it covers the codebook and the example of the process of decode the diary. Quite worth reading if you're interested at the encrptcy part like me.

# 1821
“Tuesday 12 June [Halifax]
At 10¾, Miss Rawson (Catherine) & Miss Crackenthorpe… called & staid ½ hour, Miss Rawson to say that, as it was Whitsuntide week, her father & mother did not like her to be out & hoped we should excuse her coming this evening… In the afternoon, at 5¼, walked along the new road & got past Pump when Miss Ann Walker of Crownest9 overtook me, having run herself almost out of breath. Walked with her as far as the Lidget entrance to their own grounds & got home at 6.40. Made myself, as I fancied, very agreeable & was particularly civil & attentive in my manner. I really think the girl is flattered by it & likes me. She wished me to drink tea with them. I hoped for another walk to Giles House & the readiness she expressed shewed that my proposition was by no means unwelcome. She has certainly no aversion to my conversation & company. After parting I could not help smiling to myself & saying the flirting with this girl has done me good. It is heavy work to live without women’s society & I would far rather while away an hour with this girl, who has nothing in the world to boast but good[…]”

# 1822
“Tuesday 18 June [Halifax]
Dined at 5¼, and at 6¼ off in the gig to Crownest, to take a walk with Miss Ann Walker, having talked of it ever since my walk with her last year. Only her sister & herself at home. They could not both leave the house & Miss Ann Walker & I were tête-à-tête… Very civil, etc, but she is a stupid vulgar girl. Indeed, I scarce know which of the party is the least vulgar & I have no intention of taking more walks, or letting the acquaintance go one jot further. I asked her to come to Shibden & walk in our valley & here I hope the thing will end.”

# Note
“1821
1. Cliff Hill and Crow Nest – two of the properties forming part of the Walker estate in Lightcliffe, adjacent to the Shibden estate. In 1830, Ann Walker became co-heiress, along with her sister Elizabeth, to the estate. In 1834, Ann moved in to Shibden Hall to live with Anne Lister as her wife. See ‘The Walkers of Crow Nest’, in Female Fortune: Land, Gender and Authority by Jill Liddington, River Orams Press, 1988 (pp.27–38).”

"1822
“9. Ann Walker – at this point, Anne Lister had no deep interest in her young neighbour. A decade later, however, there was a dramatic shift in Anne Lister’s attitude towards her. [See n.1.]”
