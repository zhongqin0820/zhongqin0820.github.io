# Introduction
I made up this story when I suffered the loss of chasing a job offer in the 2019's season of on-campus hiring. At the very beginning, the first conversation was written before I got a job opportunity and the remains were after I received three job offers. Thus, this story might not quite consistent in the feelings.

Spoiler: the whole story is mainly about a small talk between me and a man who said that he was I but from a parallel space-time and 15 years older than me. Obviously, the narrator isn't the true me in reality. I share this story because it's funny when you review your naive but pretending profound thought when you were suffering some difficulties that you considered you cannot conquer at a young age. Hope you'll also enjoy this made-up story with fun.

"Everything sucks", a voice groaned in the deep dark, choked in tears.
Sat alone on a bench in a dead dark corner and was full of desperate feelings in my head while got no one on sight, I was terrified out, "Who's over there?".
A dead silence, only the thumping of my heart echoed.
"Everything sucks", the voice repeated after a long sigh from the dark but this time with relief.

I lost my patience, it's wicked that you can only be terrified once by the unknown things.
I groped out my phone and lighted up the screen intend to expose him from the dark but unfortunately failed, it was too dark seemed the helpless light was swallowed by an unseen mouth from the dark, "Come out of there, or...or...".
I was still tried hard to find out a proper word but it looks like my awkwardness entertained him, he asked closely with a joy, "or what?".
A lengthened silence paused, my attention was exhausted and this time it turned out he lost his patience and finally, he stepped out of the dark.

I asked promptly, "Who are you and why are you here?".
He seemed don't want to answer the question and throw it back, "You can guess. So who are you and why are you here?".
"I asked you first", I decided to keep silence until he died out of patience.
This trick worked again, he sighed out, "I was you. I come here because you're here."
I was annoyed by this answer, "What are you talking about? this is nonsense. Are you crazy?"
"Well, I literally mean it. Whether you believe or not, the truth never changes.", he continued without hesitation, "why would I cheat you? what will I gain from cheating you?"
"I don't know, maybe you're the weird middle-aged man who likes to do some odd things.", I was curious, "Why did you cry?"
He kept a long silence to evade the question, "I cannot stay long, if you have other questions, you need to seize the minutes to ask me."

"Life is hard, isn't it?", stared at the remote dark, I soliloquised, "Life is hard".
He came up and sat in my left hand, "Yeah, life is hard", he agreed and continued with a pretend ease, "but it's also full of happiness".
"Liar, you just cried", I disproved with agitating, "I bet for life".
"Yeah", he sorrowfully sighed again, "yeah, you're right". "But believe me, happiness will forever last", he insisted, "and bitterness exists temporary and it does disappear in a short time".
I sneered back, "Wow, what a great philosopher you're, a philosopher cannot tackle his issues?".
"Hey, philosopher, you said you were me", I asked with sarcasm after an awkward silence, "will I get through the difficulties? what will I ...".
He interrupted, "You mean what? ask one question a time, please."
"You know it, you were me you said, you know what I'm suffering now", I insisted not to answer his question.
He seemed to understand it, "Come on, you call this a difficulty? you have no idea about what a true difficulty is. Kid."
"You tell me.", I respond with dignity and turned toward him.

He avoided to continue and saw into the dark where he has stepped out before, "You have a family, some good friends that care about you. You don't need to worry. They're your last fortress".
"But I don't want to disappoint them", I replied with sadness and turned back my body, looking into the dark.
He comforted with sureness, "You won't. Have you forgotten that you have already received your own personal calling? You follow your own personal legend and you won't disappoint those who love you."
"No, you evade the question, I'm not talking about chasing of personal legend. I'm talking about how to get through the difficulties I'm suffering.", I insisted.
He continued, "Well, the only thing that I can tell you is that I eat three meals a day and get up at half-past seven and sleep before ten p.m. at the time. Also, I take it as an ordeal of chasing the personal legend. And I ..."
"Bullshit, you said you were me, but these days I could only fall in sleep after zero", I interrupted him, "not even before eleven!".
"Yeah, then you need to adjust the timetable", he replied, "and take ease, it's not a big deal. everything will go well ..."
"Cliches, you weren't me", I interrupted again but with anxiety, "you know nothing about ..."

Suddenly, a strong white light came into my eyes without precognition before I could finish my sentence and forced me to close my eyes with the man's voice fading out, "I said I were you and I know you more than you know yourself...". Meanwhile, there was a little vibration made me cannot keep standing still. Finally, the light seemed dying out and I opened my eyes. There was only the bed curtain in the eyes and the vibration was from my alarm clock, it showed 7:30, it was time to get up to catch the attendance checking moment. Thus, the whole story ended without an ending.
